#+TITLE: GLANG

* Introduction

The above project is a in-progress compiler for =glang=. It leverages a custom build lexer and parser implementing the TOP-DOWN Recursive Descent Algorithm for semantic checking.

* Syntax

=glang= borrows a lot of it's syntax from =javascript=, along with it's support for functional programming

An example code is provided below

#+begin_src typescript
  let x = 51 + 21;

  const add = func(a, b) {
    a + b // Semi-colons are optional and '//' triggers a comment
  }

  let add5 = func(x) {
    return add(5,x); // Partial Application
  }
#+end_src
